# 2xA8
 Marlin 2.x for Anet A8

This is my build environment for the Anet A8, based on Marlin 2.x.  I will try to keep this updated as much as I can.  Options for your printer can still be configured through Configuration.h and Configuration_adv.h

Building:

With Optiboot bootloader:
* Choose "Anet V1.0 (Optiboot)

With regular bootloader:
* Choose "Anet V1.0"

Optiboot bootloader will allow more program space for your firmware as compared to the regular bootloader.

If you need pointers on flashing a bootloader to your board, you can check out TH3Ds site below.
